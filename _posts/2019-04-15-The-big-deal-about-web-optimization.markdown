In our daily lives as developers we are often faced with the pressure of the delivery times in the priority points of a project, which go through a stage where the QA testers perform the respective tests for the proper functioning of the page, including the measurement of the quality codes that we generate as well as the loading times of the page.

Now, as the title of the article says, the great detail exists regarding the way in which QA testers evaluate the performance of a web page or web system, is that the QA testers evaluate according to their knowledge or knowledge of an area leader, which can be variable depending on which company is currently working, that is, the results of the analysis are also variable.

But, by the way, they should not be variables, because the analysis for the optimization of web pages or systems (part of the Front-end) is already standardized and this is due to Google and a couple of very powerful tools that will be briefly explained below.

1. Google PageSpeed Insights.
As the [official documentation] says, this tool allows us to:
> Reports on the performance of a page on both mobile and desktop devices and provides suggestions on how that page may be improved.
> This score is determined by running Lighthouse to collect and analyze lab data about the page. A score of 90 or above is considered fast, and 50 to 90 is considered average. Below 50 is considered to be slow.
For more information about how the performance of a page is measured, we recommend visiting the official documentation.

2. Google Lighthouse.
Another powerful tool highly recommended to use, as described on the [official website]:
> Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.
> You can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, from the command line, or as a Node module. You give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From there, use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.

As it was observed, it is better to adopt these tools to know in detail where are the processes that slow down the load of the page, or possible vulnerabilities in it.

Finally, some facts will be shown on the advantages offered by an optimal evaluation of the web pages to make an adequate decision making to include within the delivery times the correct analysis of the web optimization.

1. Lighthouse facts from [think with Google].
- 70% of mobile pages take nearly 7 seconds for the visual content above the fold to display on the screen.
- 70% of mobile pages weigh over 1MB, 36% over 2MB and 12% over 4MB.
- As the number of elements on a page increases from 400 to 6,000, the probability of conversion drops 95%.
- As page load time goes from one second to 3 seconds, the probability of a mobile site visitor bouncing increases 32%.
- As page load time goes from one second to 5 seconds, the probability of a mobile site visitor bouncing increases 90%.
- As page load time goes from one second to 6 seconds, the probability of a mobile site visitor bouncing increases 106%.
- As page load time goes from one second to 10 seconds, the probability of a mobile site visitor bouncing increases 123%.

2. Lighthouse facts from [Google Doubleclick Blog].
- 53% of all site visits are abandoned if page load takes more than 3 seconds.
- 19 seconds is the average time a mobile web page takes to load on a 3G connection.
- 14 seconds is the average time a mobile web page takes to load on a 4G Connection.
- The BBC has seen a loss of 10% of their users for every extra second of page load.
- Rebuilding Pinterest pages for performance increased conversion rates by 15%.
- Walmart saw a 1% increase in revenue for every 100ms improvement in page load.

3. Lighthouse facts from [Google Developers Blog].
- If a site takes >1 second to become interactive, users lose attention, and their perception of completing the page task is broken.
