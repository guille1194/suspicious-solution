One of the things that I ever want to do it's a blog to talk about all my experience, knowledge and personal opinions about software development and the evolution of technology.

Because of time lacks, I was not able to make a blog in the way that I like to do, but recently I found an easy way to makes a personal blog, with any design that makes a better experience for the reader and the admin of the blog.

The tool name is Jekyll, and basically, it's a static website and blog editor that uses markdown as the way to generate content like posts.

Jekyll doesn't use databases to store the posts, basically use the free hosting with [Github Pages][gh-pages], and the way to host a page with GitHub it's uploading the entire web project to a Github repository, create a branch as gh-pages, and finally, GitHub gives you a domain to explore the website anywhere.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

That's the first post I want to share, hope to share more articles or opinions with the readers.

Greetings.
