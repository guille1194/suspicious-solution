In our daily lives as developers we are often faced with the pressure of the delivery times in the priority points of a project, which go 
through a stage where the QA testers perform the respective tests for the proper functioning of the page, including the measurement of 
the quality codes that we generate as well as the loading times of the page.

Now, as the title of the article says, the great detail exists regarding the way in which QA testers evaluate the performance of a web 
page or web system, is that the QA testers evaluate according to their knowledge or knowledge of an area leader, which can be variable 
depending on which company is currently working, that is, the results of the analysis are also variable.

But, by the way, they should not be variables, because the analysis for the optimization of web pages or systems (part of the Front-end) 
is already standardized and this is due to Google and a couple of very powerful tools that will be briefly explained below.

1. Google PageSpeed Insights.
As the official documentation says, this tool allows us to:
"Reports on the performance of a page on both mobile and desktop devices and provides suggestions on how that page may be improved.
This score is determined by running Lighthouse to collect and analyze lab data about the page. A score of 90 or above is considered 
fast, and 50 to 90 is considered average. Below 50 is considered to be slow."
For more information about how the performance of a page is measured, we recommend visiting the official documentation.

2. Google Lighthouse.
Another powerful tool highly recommended to use, as described on the official website:
"Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or 
requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.
You can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, from the command line, or as a Node module. You give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series
of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From there, use the failing audits as indicators on 
how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it."

As it was observed, it is better to adopt these tools to know in detail where are the processes that slow down the load of the page, or 
possible vulnerabilities in it.

Finally, some data will be shown on the advantages offered by an optimal evaluation of the web pages to make an adequate decision 
making to include within the delivery times the correct analysis of the web optimization.
